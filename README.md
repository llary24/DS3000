What makes a movie critically and financially successful?

This project aims to analyze the factors that contribute to a movieâ€™s financial and critical success, such as cast, director, genre, time of release, studio, plot, and awards. By examining these elements and their interactions over time, we will build a predictive model to estimate box office performance, forecast award nominations, and predict audience ratings. This research will uncover trends in popular genres and success patterns, offering insights into how societal shifts, marketing strategies, and film production choices influence a movie's outcome. Ultimately, the model could help investors make more informed decisions and assist in movie recommendations based on predicted success.
